# FunFacts
First app of the [Treehouse iOS Development Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/ios-development).

FunFacts serves up random facts when the user taps on a button. This app was built as a way to practice iOS development using the Swift language and Xcode. It makes use of views and view controllers, data models, and the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
